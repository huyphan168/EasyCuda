# EasyCuda: A Comprehensive Guide to CUDA Programming with C/C++

EasyCuda is a repository that aims to provide learning resources for programming GPUs using CUDA C/C++. It contains multiple courses that cover the basics of CUDA and various advanced topics.

## Introduction

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for performing general-purpose computing on GPUs. It allows developers to exploit the performance benefits of GPUs for computationally intensive tasks, such as machine learning, scientific simulations, and video rendering.

Learning CUDA can be challenging, especially if you're new to parallel programming or GPU architecture. The goal of EasyCuda is to provide a comprehensive learning experience that helps you understand the basics of CUDA and build your skills through various practical examples and projects.

## Courses

EasyCuda contains multiple courses that cover different aspects of CUDA programming. Here's an overview of the available courses:

1. Deep Learning Institute Nvidia - composing with multiple courses like: Fundamental CUDA programming with C/C++, Concurrent Streams, and Multi-GPUs scaling.

2. CUDA for Engineers: An Introduction to High-Performance Parallel Computing - Covering topics like Reduction or Atomic Functions, 3D data.

3. Programming in Parallel with CUDA: Pratical Guide - Covering hard topics such as Warps and Cooperative Groups, Tensor Cores, Profiling.
