## Installation
Please install PyTorch with cuda by using following command
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Since I'm using JIT compiler, you need to run the code once to compile the model. After that, you can use the model as a normal python function.
```python
python3 main.py
```
